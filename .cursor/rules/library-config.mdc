1. The library exports only one component: OrbitChart.
2. All chart behavior and configuration happen inside OrbitChart.
3. OrbitChart accepts props for:
   - data (array)
   - width, height (numbers)
   - renderPoint, renderTooltip (custom renderers)
   - scales, theme (optional)
4. Do not create multiple exported hooks, utils, or contexts. Keep all logic scoped to OrbitChart.
5. Code must be 100% React and TypeScript — no external chart or DOM libraries.
6. Use SVG and React rendering only; no canvas or imperative drawing.
7. No window, document, or manual DOM manipulation.
8. No mutable globals, side effects, or external state managers.
9. Keep all derived calculations pure functions or useMemo.
10. Props are the only source of truth. No internal data mutation.
11. Allow user renderers (renderPoint, renderTooltip) to override internal rendering.
12. Use React.FC or function components only.
13. Avoid unnecessary re-renders with memo/useCallback.
14. Always provide default width=400, height=240 if not passed.
15. If data is empty, render an empty SVG placeholder with text “No data”.
16. Keep file small: OrbitChart.tsx should define everything except large math helpers.
17. Internal helpers go in orbitMath.ts, not exported.
18. Always type everything with explicit interfaces (e.g., OrbitChartProps).
19. Do not expose implementation details or internal helpers.
20. Write code that looks like a clean, pure React library: readable, stateless, and declarative.
